# About
Educational Innovation Project (PIE) at Complutense University of Madrid. This repository contains exercises in quantum computing, which had to be completed over the course of three sessions by small teams. The tools used are Quirk and Qiskit. Each member then had to provide individual analysis and interpretation of the results.

The repository is organised into three folders, each of which contains the scripts and answers for each session. The final results are presented in `PIE_QC_ZapataFergusonM.pdf`.

If one wishes to play around with the code in the notebooks, they may install the needed dependencies with the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
